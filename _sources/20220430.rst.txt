==========================

I have upgraded my desktop computer before the lock down in Shanghai about two months ago, now I want to record the ideas and process at that time.

* CPU

  + **Intel 12700F**

  + This is one of the Intel's newest high-end CPUs, and the performance is basically overflow for my daily use, but it is said that Windows 11 can fit it better.

* Motherboard

  + **MSI 660 MORTAR**

  + One of the top rated and most recommended motherboards out there.

* RAM

  + **Crucial 16GBÃ—2 White 3200hz**

  + I am accustomed to using Crucial for RAM, this time a professional told me not to buy green.

* Power Supply

  + **CoolerMaster V750W GOLD**

  + SeaSonic might be better, and it is generally believed that gold certification and full module design are more important.

* M2 Hard Disk

  + **ADATA SX8200PRO 2T**

  + I already have a Crucial MX500 500GB and a Intel 535 120G, we'd better use SSDs instead of HDDs whenever possible.

* CPU Cooler

  + **Thermalright AK120**

* Graphics Card

  + **Gainward 3080 12G**

* Base Unit

  + **Thermaltake H6 White**

  + This is a super nice and minimalist one with a glass panel on one side.

* Monitor

  + **DELL U2720QM**

  + I've had it for two years and I feel like it can still work well for at least 5 years more.

That's it:
