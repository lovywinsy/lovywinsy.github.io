Engineer not Developer
======================

I have attended a one-week training about TDD, one of the most impressed thing is everytime when we said `developer` the trainer would correct it with `engineer`.

Obviously he thought `developer` directly determine the work of others, it's not polite at all.

Compare to `developer`, `engineer` is more accurate to describe what we are. And I believe that he must know another title in China, `Code Farmer`. I have to say it's really a bad title, it's not polite and it will make everyone's living environment worse slowly and slowly, but actually lots of people don't realize it now.
