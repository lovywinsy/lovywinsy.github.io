对罗素《留给世人的话》一直很有印象

.. epigraph::

   Russell: I should like to say two things, one intellectual and one moral.

   The intellectual thing I should want to say to them, is this: When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed. But look only, and solely, at what are the facts. That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say.

   The moral thing I should wish to say to them is very simple: I should say, love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don’t like. We can only live together in that way—and if we are to live together and not die together—we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.

   -- Bertrand Russell

那句 *what are the facts* 在这个愈发沉陷，人的情感与知觉被不断剥夺的世界里，具有沉重的现实意义。

对于 *Love is wise, hatred is foolish* ，很长时间内我只是把它当作人文主义里关于宽容&爱的一般表达。然后到了2022年的今天，我才在各种各样无法忘怀的事情里，明白了学会宽恕，那种不受现实主义和功利主义的宽恕所能带给彼此的那种..纯粹的救赎。不仅仅对于种族，国家，对你我身旁的朋友同事，至亲至爱都一样适用。
